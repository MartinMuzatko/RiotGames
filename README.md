# RiotGames
As a developer that doesn't get around to kill time by playing some flashgames every now and then, I decided to create a few browsergames myself, which serve as a foundation for other people to build upon, or learn from them.

Most of these Games are very simple, and took about 2~3 hours to develop. (From Idea to Finetuning)
These Games are made as a testcase to see how easy it is to create games with the riotjs framework (which is not necessarily made for games)
